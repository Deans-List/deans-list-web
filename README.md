**Dean’s List  - serviceDAO website Spec**

**Overview:** As part of our Solana Foundation Grant, we are building a dedicated landing page/portal for members and clients to join and work with Dean’s List 

**The goal of creating this is to**
- Make it easier for a new member to join the serviceDAO
- Make it easier for a client to engage the serviceDAO 
- Showcase what we do in this serviceDAO

**We are here to help daos get better and to that end can:**
- Help other serviceDAOs spin up their own dedicated portal and create their own token
- Integration with Realms for client processes and distribution
- Merch shop options for DAOs

**Requirements for the Portal**

For New Clients:

Acquire the required DEAN or agreed token (established with the service agreement) and send it to the Dean's List treasury – best version is to swap from any token to DEAN, but enabling the basic swap is good for this phase. Current payment is 50 DEAN but is subject to change based on the requirements and scope of the project being reviewed.

Service agreement - The agreed amount and type of tokens needs to be deposited into the Treasury account on Realms. Ideally, this deposit also comes with some information similar to the existing bounty process we use on Strata (we could also use the Strata bounty code, if that is easier, but there is the issue that the deposit goes to the mint wallet and not Realms).

If the project is not accepted by Dean's List then the payment will be refunded to the payment address that sent the tokens. No refunds will be given once a project has been started and work has begun.

Information to request:
- Name of Project
- Logo of the project
- Description of the project and feedback priorities


For Dean's List Members:

We are looking for likeminded and talented people that are passionate aboue adding value and making a difference. To gain access, you need to acquire 1 DEAN to access the Discord channels. Join in and share your experience with the growing community.
